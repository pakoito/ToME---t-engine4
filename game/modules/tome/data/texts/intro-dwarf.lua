You are a member of the proud race of the Dwarves.
Hailing from the dwarven kingdom under the Lonely Mountain you have decided to take to the road and start a new life of aventuring.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places of the world, looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to a land called Rhudaur, on the western steppes of the Misty Mountains, far away from your home, in search of the ruined tower of Amon Sûl. You heard the caves below were infested by vermin and undead.
To the east lies another dangerous place: the Trollshaws. It is an old forest infested with trolls and all kinds of wild animals.

After days of travels you have found the ruined tower and entered the caves, what will you find there...
