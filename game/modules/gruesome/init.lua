"It is pitch black.  You are likely to eat someone..."

In Gruesome you play the grue, lurking in shadows and eating adventurers.
Explore randomly generated caverns populated with wandering adventurers,
trying to avoid the light of their torches and grabbing a bite to eat when
possible.  You can't directly move into adventurers - either hang around
hoping they'll stumble into you, or snuff out their torches with a shadow
ball spell.
